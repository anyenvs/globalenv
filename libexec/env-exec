#
# Summary: Run helm with the selected version
#
# Usage: globalenv exec <command> [arg1 arg2...]
#
# Runs helm or tiller by first preparing PATH so that the selected
# version's `bin' directory is at the front.
#
# For example, if the currently selected helm version is 1.11.3:
#   globalenv exec helm version
#   globalenv exec terragrunt -version
#
# is equivalent to:
#   PATH="$GLOBALENV_ROOT/versions/1.11.3/bin:$PATH" helm version
